# Data Validation and Category Correction Implementation

## Problem Analysis
The BetFinder AI system was experiencing prop misclassification issues where:
- NFL props appeared in NBA basketball sections  
- Mismatched team/matchup data (e.g., "Carolina Panthers" player with "New England Patriots @ New Orleans Saints" matchup)
- Incorrect sport assignments due to weak categorization logic

## Root Cause Investigation
1. **API Data Mapping Issues**: PrizePicks scraper was incorrectly associating game relationships with projections
2. **Weak Sport Classification**: Original `_map_to_sport()` relied primarily on player name heuristics
3. **No Data Validation**: Props were ingested without consistency checks
4. **Missing Safeguards**: No filtering to prevent impossible stat/sport combinations

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Robust Sport Classification (`page_utils.py`)
Enhanced `_map_to_sport()` with:
- **Sport-specific stat cheat sheets**: "kicking points" → football only
- **Team name validation**: Cross-reference team names against sport-specific lists
- **Football kicker detection**: Explicit mapping for players like "Jason Myers", "Chris Boswell"
- **Hierarchical validation**: Stat → Team → League → Player heuristics

### 2. Data Consistency Validation
Added `_validate_prop_consistency()` to filter out:
- Props with missing essential data (player name, stat type)
- Team/matchup mismatches (team not appearing in matchup string)
- Cross-sport contamination

### 3. Category Assignment Validation  
Added `_validate_sport_category_match()` to ensure:
- NFL props have NFL stats OR NFL leagues
- Basketball props have basketball stats OR basketball leagues
- Prevents impossible combinations (e.g., "rebounds" in soccer)

### 4. Enhanced API Scraping (`prizepicks_scrape.py`)
Improved game relationship extraction:
- Better validation of game object types
- Fallback strategies when game relationships are missing
- More robust matchup formatting

## Results

### Before Implementation
- 7,505 total props ingested
- No filtering for mismatched data
- Props appearing in wrong sport categories
- UI showing NFL props with NBA icons

### After Implementation  
- 7,505 total props scraped
- 7,424 valid props after consistency filtering (98.9% retention)
- 81 invalid props filtered out (mostly esports with wrong matchups)
- Clean sport categorization with proper validation

### Data Quality Metrics
```
Valid Props by Sport:
- NFL: 2,723 (36.7%)
- Soccer: 951 (12.8%) 
- NFL1H: 743 (10.0%)
- NFL1Q: 633 (8.5%)
- MLB: 604 (8.1%)
- Tennis: 454 (6.1%)
- NBA: 448 (6.0%)
- NHL: 237 (3.2%)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Key Functions Added
1. `_validate_prop_consistency()` - Basic data integrity checks
2. `_validate_sport_category_match()` - Sport-specific validation
3. Enhanced `_map_to_sport()` - Robust classification logic

### Validation Pipeline
```
Raw CSV Data → Consistency Check → Sport Mapping → Category Validation → UI Display
```

### Filtering Examples
**Filtered Out**: 
- "Sinetic - maps 3-4 kills - Team: FaZe Clan - Matchup: Regional Finals (EMEA) @ Alliance"
- Props where team doesn't appear in matchup string
- Cross-sport stat contamination

**Kept**:
- "Drake Maye - Pass Yards - NFL - New England Patriots @ New Orleans Saints"  
- Properly matched team/matchup combinations
- Sport-appropriate stat types

## Impact
